    "Profile: Marcus, 45, consultant; 2 years of Notion journals and notes establish a stable writing baseline.",
    "Week 1 signal: Daily journal entries show slightly more typos and shorter sentences than usual.",
    "Week 2 linguistic: Sentence length down 18→12 words over ~10 days; vocabulary complexity ↓ ~30%; logical connectors (however, therefore) ↓ ~60%.",
    "Input modality: Voice-to-text entries include more filler words ('um', 'like'); handwriting-to-text shows slight tremor patterns.",
    "Timing/keystrokes: Writing sessions shorter but more frequent; time between keystrokes increasing; revisions shift to simple corrections vs complex edits.",
    "Content changes: Emotional range narrowed; abstract thinking decreased; memory references vaguer (e.g., 'that meeting last week').",
    "Self-report: Describes feeling just 'tired' but denies unusual stress; no acute symptoms reported."
